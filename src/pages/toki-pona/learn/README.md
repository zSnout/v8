## Mindset

- semantic spaces
- meaning over words
- the words you say put an object into a certain framing. for wood...
  - "kasi" is quite universal
  - "mani" would be good if the wood is used as currency (and nothing else)
  - "ilo" would fit when you use the wood as a makeshift hammer
  - "moku" is excellent if you feed the wood to a fire
  - "len" works if the wood is a curtain or a veil of information
- don't get stuck using a single phrase for everything
  - "awen" for one's home
  - "akesi" for trains
- beware of dictionaries
  - lipu Linku: the most well-known, but only provides a few examples for each
    word and doesn't not describe well how to generalize these examples
  - lipamanka's dictionary: gives paragraph-style descriptions of what fits into
    the semantic space of a given word. good for learning a word deeper, but may
    be bad if you just need a quick result
  - nimi.li: joins the data of lipu Linku and lipamanka's dictionary into a very
    beautiful interface. highly recommended, but stay away from the "ilo ku" and
    "sandbox" sections

## Clarifications

### ...which can be taught easily

- kin (often only used on the verb when it should be on a subject or object)
- jo (often only used in predicate position)
- anu seme (commonly at the end, but it can go anywhere)
- names
- suli vs. mute vs. wawa
- pu/ku/su
- core vs. common vs. uncommon vs. obscure vs. sandbox

### ...which don't really matter

- double pi (this is ambiguous but somehow tokiponists get by)
- anu (this is ambiguous but somehow tokiponists get by)
- lukin vs. alasa (you'll learn it eventually)
- tawa vs. tan (these seem like opposites but they're more like siblings) Ã“
