/**
 *
 * **TL;DR: A layer has preserved state, volatile async data, and goes over other
 * parts of the page. Put configuration in props, stuff you need to preserve in
 * `state`, and stuff from the database in `load` (which returns async data).**
 *
 * ---
 *
 * A layer is like a page on a website. But instead of using regular pages, the
 * learn page uses a "fake pages" system which support good transitions, loading
 * views, keyboard shortcuts, and other good things. Layers can be pushed,
 * popped, or forcefully popped via the "Learn" link in the navigation bar
 * `Esc` key on a standard keyboard. Layers also provide a solid backdrop in
 * case this application ever starts using multiple windows.
 *
 * Regarding data, a typical layer has:
 *
 * - **Props**, which are passed by the element creating the layer.
 * - **State**, which is preserved when the layer is exited and returned to
 * - **Async data**, which is initially fetched in a `load` function, and which
 *   is automatically refetched whenever the layer is returned to (because it
 *   could have potentially changed), unless this behavior is explicitly
 *   disabled.
 *
 * If there is configuration required for your layer to work, it should likely
 * be part of the layer's props.
 *
 * If you would like to preserve some state (for instance, the Browse layer
 * should keep the proper cards selected even after an upper layer is removed),
 * it must go in the `state` utility.
 *
 * If you would like to fetch something from the database, it must go in the
 * `load` utility.
 *
 * ### Lifetime of a layer
 *
 * As a layer is created, it goes through these steps:
 *
 * 1. State is created. If `layer.state == "signal"`, it is transformed into a
 *    signal.
 * 2. The async data is fetched.
 * 3. The layer is shown.
 *
 * When a layer above this one is removed, this layer goes through these steps:
 *
 * 1. The current layer is unloaded.
 * 2. The async data is refetched.
 * 3. The layer is re-rendered.
