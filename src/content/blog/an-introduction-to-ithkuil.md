title: Ithkuil for Tokiponists
draft: true
---

About a year ago, I wrote about my experience learning toki pona, one of the
world's simplest languages. Since then, I've also started learning another
language called Ithkuil, created by John Quijada in 1978.

## What are constructed languages?

_Wait,_ you may be asking. _How can a language be created by one person?_ It
turns out that this task, called **conlanging** (short for constructing
languages), is a very common art form, and is practiced by many people. If
you've ever heard of Esperanto, you might know that it was designed to be as
easy to learn as possible. Ithkuil is a constructed language, and was made by
one person for a specific purpose.

Ithkuil was designed by John Quijada as an attempt to express more of the
thoughts that go on in your mind than traditional languages can. Have you ever
struggled to tell somebody exactly what you're thinking of? Ithkuil allows you
to express that thought with an incredible amount of precision and nuance.

## Ithkuil is _NOT_ the most complicated language on Earth

Before we really get into the details of Ithkuil, I'd like to start with one
personal sentiment. Many people call Ithkuil "the world's most complicated
language," but that's not an accurate description of it at all. The only
complexity in Ithkuil is in learning the various grammatical categories and how
to put them together. In these respects, it's much easier than many languages.

Have you ever learned a second language? It's not exactly a trivial task. When
learning Spanish, native English speakers get confounded by all the word endings
and irregularities of the language, such as its past tense preterite vs.
imperfect distinction, or when to properly use ser and estar. It's the same in
every language: it's unavoidable that you'll have to learn something new.

Ithkuil is no different than natural languages in this respect. It has its new
concepts, its unique features, and has things that don't exist anywhere else.
But it's also much easier than many natural languages in some regards. First of
all, there are **no** irregularities.

To form the plural in Ithkuil, you just change its second consonant group from
-l- to -r-, so that "azval" becomes "azvar". To mark the past tense, add -aw-
before the word's final vowel cluster, to change "galái" to "galawái". In this
way, Ithkuil is much simpler than many languages. Sure, there are a few nuances
to the rules above. But they're nothing nearly as complicated as Spanish's three
verb classes, or English's absurd spelling rules.
