title: Referentials
---

Referentials are Ithkuil's pronouns. They're simple compared to the formatives
we've been talking about so far, and just look like some consonants followed by
a case ending:

```cx
¹l²o
¹me ²(ERG)

¹s²e
¹you (singular) ²(ABS)

¹z²a
¹it ²(THM)
```

To add a referential to a sentence, just place it anywhere! Like with nominal
formatives, they typically go after the main verb, but you can put them before
the main verb to emphasize them.

```cx
¹alḑalá ²zëi⁰.
¹I observe that ²it¹'s a tree⁰.

¹uḑralô ²lo ³ne⁰.
¹I imagine that ²I ¹made ³y'all ¹cyan⁰.
```

Each referent (the consonant part) comes in three variants: neutral, beneficial,
and detrimental. This lets you say whether the action or state is good, bad, or
neutral for that referent.

```cx
¹alḑalá ²zëi⁰.
¹I observe that ²it¹'s a tree⁰ ²(no sentiment)⁰.


¹alḑalá ²ţëi⁰.
¹I observe that ²it¹'s a tree⁰ ²(to its benefit)⁰.

¹alḑalá ²ḑëi⁰.
¹I observe that ²it¹'s a tree⁰ ²(to its detriment)⁰.
```

Here's the full table of referents. They have strange abbreviations. Also,
singular is called monadic and abbreviated as **m**, and plural is called
polyadic and abbreviated as **p**.

| Abbr. | Name                         | NEU | BEN | DET | Meaning                                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1m    | monadic speaker              | l   | r   | ř   | me                                                               |
| 2m    | monadic addressee            | s   | š   | ž   | you (singular)                                                   |
| 2p    | polyadic addressee           | n   | t   | d   | you (plural)                                                     |
| ma    | monadic animate 3rd party    | m   | p   | b   | he/she/they (singular)                                           |
| pa    | polyadic animate 3rd party   | ň   | k   | g   | they (animate plural)                                            |
| mi    | monadic inanimate 3rd party  | z   | ţ   | ḑ   | it                                                               |
| pi    | polyadic inanimate 3rd party | ẓ   | f   | v   | these/those things                                               |
| Mx    | mixed polyadic 3rd party     | c   | č   | j   | mixed animate+inanimate, like s/he+it, they+those, it+they, etc. |
| Rdp   | reduplicative                | th  | ph  | kh  | a 3rd party mentioned before                                     |
| Obv   | obviative                    | ll  | rr  | řř  | a 3rd party not mentioned yet                                    |
| PVS   | provisional                  | mm  | nn  | ňň  | what                                                             |

Looks like a big table! However, it's only 33 entries, and you can usually find
what you're looking for pretty easily.

Try making the following words.

1. me (beneficial, EFF)
2. you (singular, detrimental, AFF)
3. her (neutral, STM)
4. those things (detrimental, INS)

One notable thing missing from the list above is "we". Ithkuil doesn't have a
single consonant for "we", since "we" can be "me and you", "me and somebody
else", "me and you and someone else", "me and me in the mirror", and various
other combinations.

To make pronouns like "we", just smush the consonant forms of the component
referents together:

```cx
¹r²o
¹me (beneficial) ²(ERG)

¹ž²o
¹you (singular, detrimental) ²(ERG)

¹ž³r²o
¹you (singular, detrimental) ⁰and ³I (beneficial) ²(ERG)
```

If it's hard to pronounce a consonant cluster you've created, just insert **ë**
between various consonants, or at the beginning, whichever makes it work.

```cx
¹ž³r²o
¹you (singular, detrimental) ⁰and ³I (beneficial) ²(ERG)

³r⁰ë¹ž²o
³I (beneficial) ⁰and ¹you (singular, detrimental) ²(ERG)

⁰ë³r¹ž²o
³I (beneficial) ⁰and ¹you (singular, detrimental) ²(ERG)
```

Last thing! If you have two of these short referentials next to each other, you
can merge them into a single word by flipping the second one and inserting a
**w** or **y** between them:

```cx
¹rö ²ži
¹me (beneficial, EFF) ⁰and ²you (detrimental, AFF)

¹rö⁰w²iž
¹me (beneficial, EFF) ⁰and ²you (detrimental, AFF)
```
