title: Validation

That final stressed **-á** at the end of our "there is..." sentences? It
represents a grammatical category called Validation. Validation indicates how
you know a fact to be true—­what evidence you have.

Ithkuil has nine Validations, each of which can end a word:

| Abbr. | Name          | Ending | @wrap Evidence                                                | Example              |
| ----- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| OBS   | Observational | -á     | present sensory knowledge/experience                          | "I perceive..."      |
| REC   | Recollective  | -â     | past sensory knowledge/experience                             | "I remember..."      |
| PUP   | Purportive    | -é     | knowledge from a verifiable 3rd party                         | "An expert said..."  |
| RPR   | Reportive     | -í     | knowledge from any 3rd party                                  | "Someone told me..." |
| USP   | Unspecified   | -êi    | [deliberately unspecified]                                    |
| IMA   | Imaginary     | -ô     | unreal, not intended as true; based on whim/imagination/dream |
| CVN   | Conventional  | -ó     | cultural/conventional knowledge                               | "It is said..."      |
| ITU   | Intuitive     | -û     | intuition, hunch                                              | "I feel..."          |
| INF   | Inferential   | -ú     | inference from evidence                                       | "I infer..."         |

So far we've just been using the Observational, by ending our words with **-á**.
So our words **azvalá** haven't been "there is a dog"; that one is more like "I
perceive there is a dog".

Here are examples of various Validations:

```cx
¹amţra⁰l²á⁰.
²I perceive ¹it is raining⁰.

¹erryi⁰l²é⁰.
²A reputable third party says ¹somebody is doing what snow leopards usually do⁰.

¹oga⁰l²ô⁰.
²I dreamt ¹somebody was walking⁰.

¹aţla⁰l²ó⁰.
²They say ¹a bird exists⁰.

¹eḑxwa⁰l²û⁰.
²I have a hunch ¹somebody is on vacation⁰.
```
