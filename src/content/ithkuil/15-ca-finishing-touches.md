title: CA — Finishing Touches
---

Congratulations! You've officially learned all five grammatical categories
marked in the C<sub>A</sub> complex. We've just got a few finishing touches to
get to, and we'll be done.

Before getting to that, let's make a sentence using every feature of the
C<sub>A</sub> complex to celebrate what we've learned so far.

```cx table
ežtļelâ uţlalu.
I recall that a bat climed a ladder.

ežtļelâ uţla¹t⁰u.
I recall that a ¹group of ⁰bats climed a ladder.

ežtļelâ uţla²r¹z⁰u.
I recall that a ²pack of ⁰bats climed a ladder.

ežtļelâ uţla²r¹z³t⁰u.
I recall that a ³subset of ²a pack of ⁰bats climbed a ladder.

ežtļelâ uţla²r¹z³t⁴r⁰u.
I recall that ⁴several ³subsets of ²packs of ⁰bats climbed a ladder.

ežtļelâ uţla²r¹z³t⁴ř⁰u.
I recall that ⁴what I imagined to be several ³subsets of ²packs of ⁰bats climbed a ladder⁰.

ežtļe⁵r⁰â uţla²r¹z³t⁴ř⁰u.
I recall that ⁴what I imagined to be several ³subsets of ²packs of ⁰bats climbed ⁵several ⁰ladders⁰.

ežtļe⁶g⁵r⁰â uţla²r¹z³t⁴ř⁰u.
I recall that ⁴what I imagined to be several ³subsets of ²packs of ⁰bats ⁶gradually began to ⁰climb ⁵several ⁰ladders⁰.
```

It may not make much sense, but look how much meaning we can shove into just a
few consonants! Ithkuil is quite cool for that, in my opinion.

However, we've got some problems. First, C<sub>A</sub> forms are not allowed to
have the same consonant twice in a row (this is for reasons which we'll talk
about later). Second, lots of our C<sub>A</sub> forms are difficult or
impossible to pronounce. For instance:

```cx table
azva²r⁴r⁰a*
⁴one or more ⁰dogs ²with purpose

azva²ř¹k³g⁴m⁰a*
³slowly fading in ¹groups of similar, connected ⁰dogs ²without uniform purposes ⁴in general
```

@btw Those words are marked with asterisks since they aren't actual Ithkuil
words.

To solve these problems, we apply a set of changes onto the C<sub>A</sub> forms
once we've finished assembling them from Affiliation + Configuration +
Extension + Perspective/Essence. They are:

@scrollable

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>pp → mp</td>
      <td>pb → mb</td>
      <td>rr → ns</td>
      <td>[C]bm → [C]v</td>
      <td>fbm → (fv) → vw</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>tt → nt</td>
      <td>kg → ng</td>
      <td>rř → nš</td>
      <td>[C]gm → [C]x</td>
      <td>[C]çgm → ([C]çx) → [C]xw</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>kk → nk</td>
      <td>çy → nd</td>
      <td>řr → ňs</td>
      <td>[C]bn → [C]ḑ</td>
      <td>ţbn → (ţḑ) → ḑy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ll → pļ</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>řř → ňš</td>
      <td>[C]gn → [C]ň</td>
      <td>kgn → (ngn) → (nň) → ňn</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The first three columns are straightforward. If you see **-tt-** in a
C<sub>A</sub> form, change it to **-nt-**. If you see **-kg-**, change it to
**-ng-**. If you see **-rř-**, change it to **-nš-**. And so on.

The fourth column contains substitutions which only happen after a consonant.
For instance, if you see **bm-** at the beginning of a C<sub>A</sub>, don't
change it to **v-**, since there's no consonant before it. However, if you see
**-rbm-**, that should change to **-rv-**, since the **-bm-** is now preceded by
the consonant **-r-**.

This applies to everything in column four; only substitute, say, **-gn-** for
**-ň-** if the **-gn-** is after another consonant.

The fifth column contains exceptions to the first four columns. For instance, if
you had a C<sub>A</sub> of **fbm**, you would first apply the rule to change
**-bm-** to **-v-**, since it's after the consonant **f-**. However, **fv** is
still illegal according to Ithkuil's rules for how sounds can combine, so we
change it _again_, this time from **fv** to **vw**.

Another example: in the C<sub>A</sub> form **rçgm**, we first notice that we can
replace **rçgm** for **rçx**, according to column four. Then, we replace **rçx**
with **rxw**, according to column five. However, if the C<sub>A</sub> were just
**çgm** instead, with no **r-**, we would only change it to **çx**, not **xw**.

These changes are called a C<sub>A</sub> complex's _allomorphic substitutions_.

As an exercise, check each of these C<sub>A</sub> forms, and perform any
necessary allomorphic substitutions.

1. **l**
2. **tt**
3. **tļ**
4. **rř**
5. **psky**
6. **lçgn**
7. **řkgl**
8. **řkgn**
9. **rksbm**

> 9. **rksbm** becomes **rksv** by column four.

That's it! We'll do a quick recap of C<sub>A</sub> structure in the next
chapter, and then call it a day.
