Ithkuil uses a case system. This means that instead of word order, Ithkuil
attaches suffixes to nouns to indicate their role in a sentence.

What does that mean?

In English, to say "the dog bites the cat", you have to put the word in a very
specific order. First, "the dog", since they're the subject (the one doing the
biting). Second, "bites", since it's the verb (the action). Third, "the cat",
since they're the object (the one who is bitten).

If you wanted to switch the roles of subject and object, you'd have to reverse
the sentence into "the cat bites the dog". And good luck trying to move that
verb anywhere besides the middle of the sentence without sounding archaic or
like Yoda ("the cat the dog bites!").

Ithkuil uses a different system, where this sentence would look more like
**bites-치 dog-o cat-e**. The **-치** on "bites" tells us that it's the verb, the
**-o** on "dog" tells us it's the one doing the biting, and the **-e** on the
"cat" tells us it's the one who is bitting.

Using little markers like this also gives Ithkuil more flexibility. We can
totally rearrange the words in our sentence, and it still makes sense! **bites-치
dog-o cat-e** = **dog-o cat-e bites-치**, since all the words have the same
roles.

Some languages stop here. They say, "we've got a subject case and an object
case. what else could you possible need?"

Ithkuil instead opted to go with having 68 cases. (It used to have 96, but its
author did some cleaning up.)

That might sound like a lot, but it's actually significantly smaller than role
marking words in, say, English. English uses prepositions (words like with, by,
on, near, before, and during) for most of what Ithkuil calls cases, and English
has hundreds of prepositions! So Ithkuil having only 68 cases is actually quite
nice. Plus, you only need to learn a few at a time, so it's manageable.

Now that we've covered what "case" means, onto the first nine Ithkuil cases!
