title: Specification
---

All stems have four specifications. Like how a stem is a more specific version
of a root, a specification is a more specific version of a stem.

Here are some examples of various stems and their specifications:

```cx table
arr¹a⁰-
cat

arr²ä⁰-
mental identity of a cat

arr³e⁰-
physical form of a cat

arr⁴i⁰-
what cats typically do


aly¹a⁰-
making a piece of art

aly²ä⁰-
what the art depicts

aly³e⁰-
the act of making the art

aly⁴i⁰-
the medium used for the art


anš¹a⁰-
well-behaved

anš²ä⁰-
the psychological state which causes good behavior

anš³e⁰-
the physical manifestation of good behavior

anš⁴i⁰-
the entity who has good behavior
```

Usually, specifications follow this pattern:

| Abbr. | Specification | Pattern                                                             |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BSC   | Basic         | the default form; contains the Contential and Constitutive meanings |
| CTE   | Contential    | the content, spirit, essence, identity, or purpose of something     |
| CSV   | Constitutive  | the form, shape, or physical medium of something                    |
| OBJ   | Objective     | the instrument, object, result, or experiencer of an action         |

The Contential and Constitutive forms typically complement each other, and
together make up the Basic form. The Objective form is typically hard to infer.

@btw Those abbreviations (BSC, CTE, CSV, and OBJ) are used heavily on the
official <https://ithkuil.net> website hence why they're in our table.

We can use different Specifications in our "there is..." statements. Instead of
**stem + -alá**, we'll now have **specification + -lá**:

```cx
¹arr²e⁰lá⁰.
There is a ¹cat ²body⁰.

¹ufč²i⁰lá⁰.
There is ²somebody who has been ¹exiled⁰.
²Somebody has been ¹exiled⁰.


¹anš²ä⁰lá⁰.
There is a ²psychological cause leading to ¹good behavior⁰.
```
