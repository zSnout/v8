title: “There is...”
---

The simplest sentence in Ithkuil is a "there is an X" sentence. As in:

```cx
¹alḑ⁰alá.
⁰There is a ¹tree⁰.

¹ezv⁰alá.
⁰There is a ¹dog⁰.

¹orr⁰alá.
⁰There is a ¹feline⁰.

¹amţr⁰alá.
⁰There is ¹rain⁰.
⁰It is ¹raining⁰.

¹uňv⁰alá.
⁰There is ¹jubilance⁰.
⁰[Someone] ¹feels jubilant⁰.
```

It's simple: just a stem followed by **-alá**.

For more verb-like stems, this form indicates that the verb is happening, but
doesn't tell us who performs it or how.

@todo why are there two transls for amţralá and uňvalá?
