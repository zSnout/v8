title: CA — In Referentials
tag: todo

Sorry. I lied. We have a bit more of C<sub>A</sub> stuff to work through. But it
shouldn't be too bad: it's simple conjugations, not new concepts.

So far, we've only been working with C<sub>A</sub> forms in formatives. However,
we can also mark Perspective and Essence in referentials, the pronoun-like words
we worked with back in Chapter 8.

Essence is the easy one. If a referential has two or more syllables and the last
syllable is stressed, it takes RPV (Representative) Essence. Otherwise, it takes
NRM (Normal). If a referential doesn't have two syllables but you want to make
it RPV, just add the vowel **ë-** to the beginning.

```cx table
lo
me (ERG)

ëlo
me (ERG)

ël¹ó
me (ERG) ¹(all RPV)


zërme
it + me (BEN) + they (singular, ABS)

zërm¹é
it + me (BEN) + they (singular, ABS) ¹(all RPV)

soy¹á⁰d
you (singular, ERG) + you (plural, THM) ¹(all RPV)
```

@todo There's also a way to add Perspective into Referentials. It's not listed
here since this is a work-in-progress article. See the official Ithkuil site or
Yuorb for more information.
