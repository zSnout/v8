The next five grammatical categories we're going to learn are all part of
something called the **C<sub>A</sub> slot**, sometimes called the
**C<sub>A</sub> complex**. The capital **C** stands for consonant, since it's
always one or more consonants, but never has any vowels. The <sub>A</sub>
doesn't really mean anything.

When all five grammatical categories in the C<sub>A</sub> slot take their
default values, the slot just becomes **-l-**. This is what that lone **-l-** in
all our formatives has been: it's an empty C<sub>A</sub> slot.

Here's a rough overview of the five grammatical categories in the C<sub>A</sub>
slot. We'll look at each one in depth later, so don't worry if you don't
understand them yet.

| Name          | @wrap What It Does                                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Affiliation   | indicates the relationship between the purposes or functions of members of a group |
| Configuration | turns a single object/event into a pair or group                                   |
| Extension     | focuses on a specific portion of an object/event                                   |
| Perspective   | distinguishes singular, collective, general, and abstract things                   |
| Essence       | explains whether an object/event is real or merely theoretical                     |

The C<sub>A</sub> slot essentially operates by sticking the consonant forms for
all five of these categories together and calling it a day. It's a bit more
complicated, but that's the rough idea.
