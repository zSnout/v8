title: CA — Affiliation
---

Affiliation describes how related something's purposes or functions are. Is
there a single purpose, or many? If many, are they a means to an end, or are
they unrelated?

English usually marks purpose by word choice. For instance, the word "grove"
just means "a group of similar trees". However, if those trees were planted by
design, they might instead be called an _orchard_. Similarly, a group of people
might be a simple _gathering_, neutral with respect to purpose, or a _team_, all
working together to achieve a common objective, or a _crowd_ with an absence of
purpose.

Ithkuil, on the other hand, marks purpose with a consonant in the C<sub>A</sub>
slot, making it possible to derive words like orchard, team, and crowd without
needing to memorize more vocab.

Here is an overview of the four Affiliations. We'll talk a little more about
each one later.

| Abbr. | Name          | Form   | @wrap Meaning                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CSL   | Consolidative | —      | neutral with respect to purpose or function                                     |
| ASO   | Associative   | l (nļ) | with a single purpose                                                           |
| COA   | Coalescent    | r (rļ) | with many different immediate purposes but working towards a single one overall |
| VAR   | Variative     | ř (ň)  | with many different purposes                                                    |

If all C<sub>A</sub> categories are default (for now, that means Uniplex
Configuration) except Affiliation, the C<sub>A</sub> becomes the parenthesized
Affiliation form (nļ, rļ, or ň). Otherwise, it becomes the normal Affiliation
form (l, r, or ř) followed by the Configuration form. Here are some example
usages:

```cx table
alḑala
tree

alḑa¹t⁰a
¹grove ⁰(¹group of similar, separate ⁰trees)

alḑa²l¹t⁰a
²orchard ⁰(grove ²with a purpose⁰)


oţkha¹z⁰a
¹group of ⁰armed forces

oţkha²r¹z⁰a
²troop

oţkha²ř¹z⁰a
²disorganized group of ⁰armed forces


aẓa¹c⁰a
¹pair of ⁰eyes

aẓa²r¹ca
¹pair of ⁰eyes ²used complementarily


arļni¹c⁰a
¹pair of ⁰favorable circumstances

arļni²l¹c⁰a
¹pair of ⁰favorable circumstances ²which are favorable for the same reason

arļni²r¹c⁰a
¹pair of ⁰favorable circumstances ²which are favorable for different reasons, but which both contribute to a single overall purpose

arļni²ř¹c⁰a
¹pair of ²unrelated ⁰favorable circumstances


egalá⁰.
Somebody runs.

ega²nļ⁰á⁰.
Somebody runs ²with intention, for a single reason⁰.

ega²rļ⁰á⁰.
Somebody runs ²for many reasons, all of them working to achieve a larger goal⁰.

ega²ň⁰á⁰.
Somebody runs ²for many unrelated reasons⁰.

Let's talk a little more about each Affiliation.

- **CSL (Consolidative)**

  CSL is great if you don't know the purpose or intent of something, or if it's
  not important. It's commonly used on nouns in the Uniplex, where purpose or
  function isn't that important, and on verbs in the Uniplex, where it signifies
  that the action is neutral with respect to purpose.

- **ASO (Associative)**

  Good use cases for ASO on groups include things like turning a single
  _soldier_ into a _troop_. It's also useful for marking a unity in the purpose
  of a single thing, as in _@⁰a ²well-formed ⁰rock_, _@⁰a tree ²with integrity_
  or _@⁰a ²balanced ⁰work of art_.

  On verbs, the CSL vs. ASO distinction can specify that a verb was done with
  intention. A sentence like "I look at the window" has no sense of purpose in
  CSL, but with ASO, it indicates that looking at the window was done for some
  unspecified reason.

- **COA (Coalescent)**

  COA works well on groups which work together. For instance, _group of tools_
  could become _toolbox_ in the COA, since each tool does a different job (a
  screwdriver and saw are totally different, for instance), but they all work to
  help with construction.

  Another example: _food_ could become _well-balanced meal_, since each piece of
  food on a plate serves a different purpose (carbohydrates, proteins, and
  fibers are quite different), but they all work to build a single meal.

  COA is also often used with Duplex groups, since two items in a pair typically
  complement each other, such as how your two ears hear in different directions
  but work together to build a single mental image of where sounds originate.

  Finally, COA can go on verbs to emphasize that each component of the verb
  works together. For instance, it distinguishes "He traveled in the Yukon"
  (CSL), which doesn't really feel like it has any purpose, from "He ventured in
  the Yukon" (COA), which tells us that he spent time in the Yukon, likely to
  see many things or hike many trails.

- **VAR (Variative)**

  VAR is for when the purposes of something are in conflict with each other or
  are totally unrelated. It could be used to make _a cacophony of notes_,
  _somebody at odds with themselves_, _a chaotic piece of art_, or _a rag-tag
  group_.

  On verbs, the Variative can describe especially complicated phenomena. For
  instance, if you described a light blinking as the MSC of a single light
  blink, adding VAR would mean that each blink signals something different.

I didn't come up with all of them myself.
