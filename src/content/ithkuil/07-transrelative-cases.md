title: Transrelative Cases

Before I explain any more, here's an overview:

| Abbr. | Name         | Ending | @wrap Role                                                 |
| ----- | ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| THM   | Thematic     | -a     | content used as part of the verb, but which doesn't change |
| INS   | Instrumental | -ä     | the instrument/tool used                                   |
| ABS   | Absolutive   | -e     | who tangibly changes as part of the action                 |
| AFF   | Affective    | -i     | who experiences a passive state of existence               |
| STM   | Stimulative  | -ëi    | the trigger for a sensory experience or state of existence |
| EFF   | Effectuative | -ö     | who enables somebody else to start a new action            |
| ERG   | Ergative     | -o     | who tangibly changes another party                         |
| DAT   | Dative       | -ü     | who you give something to; the recipient of an action      |
| IND   | Inducive     | -u     | ABS and ERG, simultaneously                                |

@btw Yup, those endings are just the unstressed versions of the Validation
endings. Less memorization!

Before learning how these work in Ithkuil, let's try figuring out which of these
nine roles best fit various nouns in some English sentences.

1. **@¹The dog** paints **@²the cat** blue **@³with a paintbrush**.
2. **@¹I** hear **@²a bee**.
3. **@¹You** entertain **@²your friends**.
4. **@¹She** is running.
5. **@¹The machine** throws **@²a ping-pong ball** **@³at him**.

You probably have zero experience right now, so guess the case of each
highlighted noun, but don't worry about getting them wrong.

> 1. **@¹The dog (ERG)** paints **@²the cat (ABS)** blue **@³with a paintbrush
>    (INS)**.
>
>    Classic case of something tangibly changing something else. The paintbrush
>    is Instrumental because it's a tool used for the painting.
>
> 2. **@¹I (AFF)** hear **@²a bee (STM)**.
>
>    In this case, the bee is a stimulus for your sensory experience of hearing.
>    This is certainly a passive experience, making you Affective.
>
> 3. **@¹You (EFF)** entertain **@²your friends (AFF)**.
>
>    This is a weird one. Your friends are definitely receiving a passive
>    experience, so they're easily Affective. Your friends can then choose
>    whether or not to be entertained: they could just as easily hate whatever
>    you're entertaining them with, or be indifferent to it. This then makes you
>    Effectuative because you enable them to be entertained, but you don't
>    actually force it.
>
> 4. **@¹She (IND)** is running.
>
>    She is Inducive because running not only takes willful desire on your part
>    to kick legs and keep running, making you Ergative, but it also changes
>    many parts of your body (consuming nutrients and stores sugars), making you
>    Absolutive. Ergative plus Absolutive makes Inducive, so that's the case we
>    assign.
>
> 5. **@¹The machine (ERG)** throws **@²a ping-pong ball (THM)** **@³at him
>    (DAT)**.
>
>    The machine is Ergative because it causes a tangible change in the world
>    (the presence of a ping-pong ball), the ping-pong ball is Thematic since
>    it's just transferred, and he is Dative since he received the ball.

How do we use these in Ithkuil? Basically, do the normal formula for a "there
is" verb, but instead of ending it with a Validation, we'll end it with a Case.

The only difference between a word with Validation and a word with Case is the
stress, so make sure to write it properly!

```cx
¹azva⁰l²o
¹a dog ²(ERG)
≈ ²comitted by ¹a dog

¹uřxrai⁰l²ä
¹citrus juicer ²(INS)
²using ¹a citrus juicer

¹elni⁰l²ö
¹what happens at nighttime ²(EFF)
≈ ²caused by ¹what happens at night
```

@btw These words are called nominal formatives. They're nominal since they
represent nouns, and they're formatives since they're basically verbal
formatives, but with a case ending instead of a Validation ending.

Of course, these are just lone words. To put them into a sentence, just... put
them in a sentence! Normally, nouns go after the main verb, but you can put a
noun before the main verb to emphasize it, sort of like English italics or
underlining.

Let's attach all our nouns to this verb:

```cx
¹uţrra⁰l²é⁰.
²A trustworthy source says ⁰there is ¹a declaration⁰.
```

In order to make our first big sentence:

```cx
¹uţrralé ²azvalo ³uřxrailä ⁴elnilö⁰.
¹A trustworthy source says ²a dog ¹is making a declaration ³using a citrus juicer⁰, ⁴due to what happens at night⁰.
```

@btw You might wonder why the dog is Ergative even though it's just speaking.
The reason is that a declaration immediately changes something, whether it be
through the legal system or through physical action, and so the dog can be
considered Ergative.
