Ithkuil has 30 consonants **bcčçdḑfghjklļmnňprřsštţvwxyzžẓ**, 9 vowels
**aäeëiöoüu**, and the glottal stop **'**.

Ithkuil vowels can be stressed. To mark a vowel as stressed, change **aeiou** to
**áéíóú** and **äëöü** to **âêôû**.

Ithkuil also has 10 diphthongs: **ai au ei eu ëi ou oi iu ui ëu**. These should
be pronounced as a smooth flow from the first vowel to the second, not as two
separate vowels. To stress a diphthong, stress the first letter, as in **ái êi
ói**.

An Ithkuil syllable contains one vowel or diphthong.

There are four types of stress in Ithkuil:

| Name            | Examples                    | Indicated by...                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| monosyllabic    | a, lai, fal                 | having exactly one syllable                  |
| ultimate        | arral**á**, maţřëull**ái**t | stress on the last vowel or diphthong        |
| penultimate     | arrala, maţřëullait         | unmarked stress                              |
| antepenultimate | **á**rrala, m**á**ţřëullait | stress on the 3rd-to-last vowel or diphthong |

We'll learn about how stress affects words later.
