This section is a record of all errors I've corrected so far.

<div class="contents [&_em]:text-z-subtitle [&_em]:not-italic">

1. Recolored the word "cyan" in the sentence **@cx ¹I imagine that ²I ¹made
   ³y'all ²cyan⁰**, as it should actually be **@¹cyan**, since it's part of the
   verb.
2. Capitalized Case in "07 — Cases — Transrelative" when it refers to the
   Ithkuil grammatical category, as opposed to the linguistic notion of case.
