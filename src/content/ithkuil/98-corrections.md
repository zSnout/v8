This section is a record of all errors I've corrected so far.

<div class="contents [&_em]:text-z-subtitle [&_em]:not-italic">

1. Recolored the word "cyan" in the sentence **@cx ¹I imagine that ²I ¹made
   ³y'all ²cyan⁰**, as it should actually be **@¹cyan**, since it's part of the
   verb.
2. Capitalized Case in "07 — Cases — Transrelative" when it refers to the
   Ithkuil grammatical category, as opposed to the linguistic notion of case.
3. Recolored the phrase "birds exists" in **@cx They say a ¹group of dissimilar,
   fused birds exists⁰** to **@⁰grey**, since it's not part of the
   Configuration.
4. Changed the translation of "troop" from **@⁰oţkha²r¹z⁰a** to
   **@oţkha²l¹z⁰a**, since each soldier in a troop can typically do the same
   actions as most other soldiers.
5. Put back most of the C<sub>A</sub> — Configuration chapter, which has been
   missing for a while.
6. Fixed roots in section 04; the root `ňs` was incorrectly used when it should
   be `nš`.
7. Fixed consonant form for `MDF` in the C<sub>A</sub> — Configuration chapter;
   it was previously listed as `č`, but has now been corrected to `ç`.
8. Fixed Perspective forms for N and A as listed in "14 — C<sub>A</sub> —
   Essence" and "15 — C<sub>A</sub> — Overall Structure"; **w (v)** and **y
   (j)** should be listed under `N` and `A` respectively.
