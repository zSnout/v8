title: CA — Essence
---

Essence is the final C<sub>A</sub> category. It asks a simple question: is
something real or hypothetical? There are two flavors of Essence:

| Abbr. | Name           | Meaning                                                                    |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NRM   | Normal         | the object/event(s) are real, actual, and exist                            |
| RPV   | Representative | the object/event(s) are possibilities, hypothetical, imagined, or not true |

NRM (Normal) Essence is what we've used so far in our formatives, and it's the
default Essence.

When do you use RPV (the Representative)? Examples are the easiest way to
demonstrate it.

- **The boy ran off to sea.**

  Everything in this sentence is NRM, since the boy and sea appear to exist, and
  the running definitely happened.

- **They can sing beautifully.**

  Here, they may never sing again, so _sing_ needs to be in RPV, since it's a
  description of something which might not actually happen. On the other hand,
  they do seem to exist, so _they_ can be in NRM.

- **The clown imagines they are seeing a ghost.**

  Here, the clown is NRM, since they exist. The seeing, however, should be RPV,
  since it was only imagined, and didn't actually happen. Finally, the ghost is
  in NRM, since it exists within the context of the clown's seeing, which was
  already marked RPV.

  If we marked both the seeing and the ghost as RPV, the sentence would more
  closely resemble "The clown imagines they are seeing what they imagine to be a
  ghost", which is likely not what we want.

- **She's going to walk to the beach.**

  Here, we can't be certain whether the walking can happen, since it's in the
  future tense, so it needs to be RPV. _She_ and _beach_ can both be NRM though,
  since they exist.

@cite Most examples in this section were adapted from
[ithkuil.net, section 3.5](https://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_03_morphology.htm#:~:text=of%20an%20explanation%E2%80%99-,3.5%C2%A0%C2%A0%20Essence,-Essence%20refers%20to).

Unlike the other C<sub>A</sub> categories, Essence does not add a new consonant
form to the overall C<sub>A</sub> form. Instead, the Perspective form changes if
Essence is RPV. Here is the complete chart:

| Perspective       | NRM (Normal) | RPV (Representative) |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| M (Monadic)       | — (l)        | l (tļ)               |
| G (Agglomerative) | r            | ř                    |
| N (Nomic)         | w (v)        | m / h₂               |
| A (Abstract)      | y (j)        | n / ç₂               |

You already know the NRM column; it's the Perspective values from the last
section.

The RPV column isn't too difficult to use. Normally, you just attach the normal
form (l/ř/m/n) after Affiliation, Configuration, and Extension. There are two
exceptions:

- If you're using M+RPV and it's the only thing in the C<sub>A</sub> slot, use
  the standalone **-tļ-** form instead of **-l-**. This distinguishes it from
  plain M+NRMm, which would also be **-l-**.
- If you're using N+RPV or A+RPV and the **-m-/-n-** would come after a
  consonant followed by **-t**, **-p**, or **-k**, use the ₂ form (h/ç).

Some examples contrasting NRM and RPV conjugations:
