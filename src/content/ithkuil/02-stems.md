title: Stems
---

To actually use an Ithkuil root as part of a word, you need to pick one of its
three stems. A stem is a sub-meaning of the full root:

```cx
¹a⁰lḑ-
tree

²e⁰lḑ-
shrub

³u⁰lḑ-
bush


¹a⁰mţr-
rain

²e⁰mţr-
snow

³u⁰mţr-
hail


¹a⁰ňv-
delight

²e⁰ňv-
happiness

³u⁰ňv-
jubilance
(short-term joy)
```

Stem 1 always starts with **a-**, stem 2 always starts with **e-**, and stem 3
with **u-**.

There is also a Stem Zero form, which encompasses all three stems. It's written
with **o-** before the root.

```cx
⁴o⁰lḑ-
tree/shrub/bush

⁴o⁰mţr-
water-based weather phenomenon

⁴o⁰ňv-
delight/happiness/jubilance
```
