title: Word Structure

First interlude! (That's what the trail signs mean.) In this document,
interludes are mini-review sections.

For this one, we'll look at the overall structure of words we can make so far.

```cx
¹e²zv³i⁰l⁴ó⁰.
```

| Text        | Category      | Looks Like                 | What It Does                                    |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **@cx ¹e**  | Stem          | a, e, u, o                 | narrows down on the meaning of the root         |
| **@cx ²zv** | Root          | consonant(s)               | gives the word a very broad meaning             |
| **@cx ³i**  | Specification | a, ä, e, i                 | narrows down on the meaning of the stem         |
| **l**       | \<no clue>    | just l                     | \<no idea>                                      |
| **@cx ⁴ó**  | Validation    | á, â, é, ê, êi, ô, ó, û, ú | explains what evidence we have for the sentence |

For now, it looks like we have four grammatical categories to play with, plus
the root. Root typically isn't counted as a grammatical category, since there
are 6000 different roots.
