title: CA — Extension
---

Extension, the third C<sub>A</sub> category, lets us pick a portion of an object
or event to focus on, like the phrases "beginning of", "end of", "part of", and
"entirety of" in English.

Here are the six Extensions:

| Abbr. | Name         | Form    | Portion           |
| ----- | ------------ | ------- | ----------------- |
| DEL   | Delimitive   | —       | the entirety      |
| PRX   | Proximal     | t / d₁  | a subsection      |
| ICP   | Inceptive    | k / g₁  | the beginning     |
| ATV   | Attentuative | p / b₁  | the end           |
| GRA   | Graduative   | g / gz₁ | a slow "fade in"  |
| DPL   | Depletive    | b / bz₁ | a slow "fade out" |

DEL, being unmarked (its form is empty), is what we've used up until now in our
formatives. Notice how ICP and ATV complement each other, and how GRA and DPL
are basically the slow fading equivalents of ICP and ATV.

Here are some English phrases in each Extension to give you an idea of what they
do:

| @wrap DEL (Delimitive) | @wrap PRX (Proximal)          | @wrap ICP (Inceptive)                  | @wrap ATV (Attenuative)          | @wrap GRA (Graduative)             | @wrap DPL (Depletive)                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| river                  | part of a river               | source/onset of a river                | endpoint of a river              | gradual flow into a river          | gradual end of a river (where it flows out to sea) |
| situation              | the midst of a situation      | the beginning of a situation           | a situation's end                | an evolving situation              | gradual disappearance of a situation               |
| transportation system  | an area of a transport system | the initial part of a transport system | final part of a transport system | transition into a transport system | transition out of a transport system               |
| explanation            | portion of an explanation     | the beginning of an explanation        | the end of an explanation        | a gradual explanation              | gradual end of an explanation                      |

To mark Extension in the C<sub>A</sub> slot, put its normal form (t/k/p/g/b)
after the Affiliation and Configuration forms. If the word has UPX (Uniplex)
Configuration, use the form with a little ₁ subscript (d/g/b/gz/bz). This makes:

```cx table
elzela
river

elze³d⁰a
³part of ⁰a river

elze³g⁰a
³source of ⁰a river

elze³b⁰a
³where ⁰a river ³flows out to sea

elze³gz⁰a
³gradual transition into ⁰a river

elze³bz⁰a
³gradual transition out of ⁰a river


apsu²l¹ç⁰a
situation (¹series of dissimilar ⁰events ²happening for the same reason⁰)

apsulç³t⁰a
³middle of ⁰a situation

apsulç³k⁰a
³beginning of ⁰a situation

apsulç³p⁰a
³end of ⁰a situation

apsulç³g⁰a
³gradual onset of ⁰a situation

apsulç³b⁰a
³gradual ending of ⁰a situation


ujra²r¹f⁰a
transportation system (¹set of dissimilar, connected ⁰usages of transportation methods ²each with a different individual purpose, but with a single collective one⁰)

ujrarf³t⁰a
³part of ⁰a transportation system

ujrarf³k⁰a
³beginning of ⁰a transportation system

ujrarf³p⁰a
³end of ⁰a transportation system

ujrarf³g⁰a
³gradual transition into ⁰a transportation system

ujrarf³b⁰a
³gradual transition out of ⁰a transportation system
```

@btw Like Affiliation, Extensions have two forms so that they don't get confused
with other forms. For instance, PRX is normally **-t-**, but if it were **-t-**
even with UPX Configuration, we wouldn't be able to tell if a C<sub>A</sub> of
**-t-** was MSS Configuration or PRX Extension. Therefore, we need to change it
to **-d-** so it doesn't get confused with Configuration.

Let's look at some examples of using different Extensions for the same English
sentence.

1. **She climbed the tree.**

   If we put "climb" in DEL, it emphasizes that she climbed the entire tree,
   from beginning to end. If we instead put "climb" in PRX, it tells us that he
   only climbed a portion of the tree, but not the whole thing.

2. **The tree is hard there.**

   Here, "tree" is probably best in PRX, since the tree was apparently only
   checked for hardness in one place, and we don't know about the rest of the
   tree. If we used ICP, it could instead connote that we checked the bottom of
   the tree, since that's where trees start from. Or we could use ATV to say
   "the tree is hard in the tips of its branches".

3. **Let's wait for daybreak.**

   If we use ICP for "daybreak", it emphasizes that the transition from night to
   day happens rather quickly, or that we don't care about the transition. If we
   instead use GRA, it tells us that the transition happens slowly, with the sun
   gradually rising over the horizon.

4. **We await your arrival.**

   ATV is probably the best choice for "arrival", since we're waiting for your
   arrival to complete. If we're in a busy place, where part of your arrival
   includes parking and walking to our meeting location, I don't care when you
   park—I'm waiting for you to finish your arrival and be at my location, not
   for you to pay the parking meter.

5. **She disappeared into the twilight.**

   DPL works best here if the disappearance was slow, as if she walked into the
   night. If the disappearance was rapid or instantaneous, ATV could also work.
